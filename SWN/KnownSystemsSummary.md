# Known Systems Summary for Ikuman Arm Core Systems - Buevette, Hani, Quelzadi, Thorhill, and Heeliff

This is a setting document that contains public knowledge of the isolated sub-constellation known as the "Ikuman Arm". Your character may know more due to their special knowledge, connections, or cultural position. Ask the GM!

## System: Buevette

### Elevator Pitch
The planet has (basically) Amish people, and rest of the system has Space Prospectors. People from the planet are temporarily permitted by their village elders to go to space and become space miners/prospectors, where they have their own high tech society of rowdy bearded guys. 

### Themes: 
Theres a big contrast/tension between what is allowed on the planet, and what is allowed in space. 
The "Election" process isn't very honest
Space Prospectors
Everyone has a beard

### Description

The Buevete system is divided between:

Buevete Prime, a temperate planet supporting a traditionalist society with strict rules about accumulating wealth and power. The majority of the population lives in tight-knit village communities governed by town councils. Citizens are mandated by societal law to keep a agricultural, small town lifestyle, with the only exception being those that are "Elected" to serve in a technical capacity (usually meaning offworld). Ultimate governance resides at the city called Port, at the Council of Councils. 

Buevete Outworlders, while nominally part of the same society as terrestrial Buevetans, have their own culture. Many of the strictures of the Buevettan lifestyle are relaxed while in space. Prospectors, miners, manufacturers, and traders ply their trade in the asteroid belts and comet clouds. The center of their society lies at The Fridge, a comet mining station orbitting the frozen pluto-like planet Icebox.

### History 

#### Pre Scream 

Buevete was founded by trancendentalist anarchists in the waning days of the Human Mandate. Protesting the corruption inherient in hierarchaical societies, especially those oriented around technology, they strictly enforced a purely agricultural lifestyle. A small cadre of carefully selected specialists were permitted to interact with visiting Mandate Colonial Authorities, but the majority of the society did not interact with anything would look out of place in 1850s America.

#### Post Scream 

In general, the Buevettan planet's soceity has remained extremely stable, with the exception of the Election system. Increasing percentages of the population seek and recieve election, and election has taken on the reputation of being a rite of passage (although it is still taboo to be referred to as such).

## Hani System

### Elevator Pitch
Three desert worlds. This system has mysterious crystal flower aliens that grow from mysterious ruins, are mysteriously psionic, but have never been known to move or communicate. The system has two inhabitted planets, Quelzadi, which has scientists studying the aliens, and Thorhill, an (Iran-like) theocracy worshipping the aliens. They were previously one people, but evil experimentation by the Quelzadi on the helpless aliens caused a schism. The current Quelzadi are "reformed" and disavvow their ancient crimes, but are still hated by the Thorhillians. 

### Themes
Reference - Psychiatry - An Industry of Death "Museums?"
Scientific Experimentation Constrained by Scientific Prohibition
The Quelzadi are very advanced but have a small population and live on a harsh world
The Thorhil are primitive but are modernizing quickly but have highest pop in the known sector
Supposed to empathize with both sides', and both views of the Aliens

## Quelzadi

## Thorhill

## Heeliff System

### Out of Universe Elevator Pitch.
Space Sparta. They live on a planet with a nice mediterranean climate, but it has totally devestating radiation storms, and their entire population lives deep underground, in crowded, bunker-like city of Core. Recent breakthroughs in their shielding technology has allowed people to start living normal lives, but their society still marches to the 10-day rythym before the next storm.

### Themes
Advanced tech driven by necessity (Shielding, Medicine, Gene-Tech)
An extremely brutal society that doesn't have to be brutal all of a sudden
The more powerful you are, the deeper in the city you dwell
Any Misfits would probably want to get the hell out!



Past huge layers of both lead shielding and their Aegis techno-shields, their population has strived desperately to improve their lot, and in the past 30 years the erection of a geosynchronous shield space station
